

subject = code of the subject (1 to 6)
activity = name of the activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING)

The following variables provide the mean value by subject and type of activity of different parameters (body acceleration, gravity acceleration, body gyroscope, body jerk, magnitude of the gyroscope...) in three different directions (X, Y or Z denoting 3-axial signals). All the variables are measured in Hz.
